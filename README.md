# SmartKnock-Vibration-Monitor
The vibration meter project primarily involves the use of a piezoelectric sensor, which is a device that can generate an electrical charge in response to mechanical stress or vibration. The sensor is placed on the doorframe or nearby surface, and it detects the vibrations caused by knocking on the door or other movements in the room.

Once the piezoelectric sensor detects the vibration, it sends a signal to the AVR microcontroller, which has been programmed using C language to interpret the signal and execute the desired function. In this case, the function is to send an SMS message to the owner's phone using the SIM800 module.

The SIM800 module is a GSM/GPRS-based module that enables communication between the microcontroller and the phone network. It has the capability to send and receive SMS messages, making it an ideal choice for this project.

The system's design is straightforward, and the components used are easily available and cost-effective. The AVR microcontroller is a popular choice among hobbyists and professionals alike due to its versatility and user-friendly interface. The code has been written in C language, which is a widely used programming language for embedded systems.

In summary, the vibration meter project is an innovative and practical application of piezoelectric sensors and GSM/GPRS technology. It provides an efficient solution to monitor visitors in a person's absence, and it can be implemented in various settings to improve security and convenience.
This innovative project can be implemented in various settings such as hostels, hotels, hospitals, or any other place where people need to be alerted about the visitors' arrival in their absence. It saves time and effort spent on waiting for someone to arrive and provides an efficient solution to monitor visitors.
